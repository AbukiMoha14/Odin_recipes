    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pizza is a dish of Italian origin, made with an oven-baked, flat, generally round bread that is often covered
        with tomatoes or a tomato-based sauce and mozzarella cheese. Other toppings are added according to region,
        culture, or personal preference. Originating as a part of Italian cuisine, the dish has become popular in many
        different parts of the world, particularly the United States, where numerous varieties have been developed,
        pizza restaurant chains have flourished, and pizza has become a home delivery item as well as being available as
        a frozen food ready to bake at home.

        Today, pizza is a symbol of several cultures: Italians, particularly from Naples, are proud of authentic pizza
        made with local ingredients and following strict guidelines for preparation. In the United States, pizza has
        iconic status as a typical American food, quickly prepared and readily available, and enjoyed by people of all
        ages at social occasions as well as family meals. The different styles, from places such as New York City and
        Chicago, reflect the diversity of American culture. Countries throughout the world have adopted pizza as a
        favorite food, adding their own variations to make this dish their own.</p>
