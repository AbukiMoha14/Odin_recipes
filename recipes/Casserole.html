    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A casserole is a one-dish meal that’s baked and served from a sturdy baking dish that’s itself known as a
        casserole.

        Casseroles can be main courses or side dishes like gratins or the famous Thanksgiving green bean casserole.
        They're often defined by the vessel they're baked and served in, which is called a casserole dish. The
        ingredients in a casserole can be layered or simply mixed together. And although oven-baked pasta dishes like
        lasagna and baked ziti are technically casseroles they’re not known as such; those are called baked pastas.

        Casseroles are found in many cuisines, but have a particular place in American culture. They can be elegant, but
        casseroles are one of the pillars of comfort food: straightforward, warming dishes that serve a crowd and almost
        always provide another meal (or two) of easy-to-reheat leftovers. A casserole is also an iconic food gift
        brought to occasions and celebrations ranging from potlucks to family reunions to housewarmings. They’re often
        dropped off to support households going through everything from new babies to bereavements to illness; it’s a
        dish that can in itself be a statement of caring.</p>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a large, flameproof casserole. Season chicken pieces and brown all over for 10min. Remove and
            set aside. Drain fat from the pan - there should be around 75ml (3fl oz). Pour just 1tbsp oil back in to the
            pan and discard the rest. Preheat oven to 200ºC (180ºC fan oven) mark 6.</li>
        <li>Add the onion, garlic, celery, carrots, leeks and potatoes to the pan, and cook, stirring, for 5-10min. Stir
            in the flour, cook for 2min, then pour in the stock. Season well, then return the browned chicken to the
            pan. Add the rosemary, squeeze over the juice from the lemon half and pop the squeezed lemon half into the
            pan. Cover and bring the casserole to the boil.</li>
        <li>Cook in the oven for 25-30min until the chicken is cooked through and the sauce is piping hot and thickened.
